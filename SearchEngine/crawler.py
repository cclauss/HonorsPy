ToDo: 
Only crawl websites that the admin(me) adds to list of websites, this can save space and improve performance.
But not all the websites will be added by the admin, only websites that do not have the domain extensions like .gov, .org, .edu will be added by 
me. This is to include only reliable and credible sources where people can easily find useful information. 
This might change in the future, so the goal is to code the crawler in such a way that if I decide to let the crawler crawl every single 
domain name available then it will do without me having to change that much code, hopefully I will only have to change one line of code.
